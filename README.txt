A WordPress plugin that will block any comment and pingback spams posted from 
outside of your nation.

== Description ==

This plugin will examine a country code based on the IP address. If the 
comment or pingback comes from specific country, it will be blocked before 
Akismet validate it.

= Features =

1. Free IP Geolocation database and REST APIs are installed in this plugin 
to get a country code from an IP address. There are two types of API which 
support only IPv4 or both IPv4 and IPv6. This plugin will automatically 
select an appropriate API.

2. [MaxMind](http://www.maxmind.com "MaxMind - IP Geolocation and Online Fraud Prevention") 
GeoLite free database for IPv4 and IPv6 will be downloaded and updated 
(once a month) automatically.<br><br>And if you have correctly installed 
one of the IP2Location plugins (
    [IP2Location Tags](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-tags/ "WordPress - IP2Location Tags - WordPress Plugins"),
    [IP2Location Variables](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-variables/ "WordPress - IP2Location Variables - WordPress Plugins"),
    [IP2Location Country Blocker](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-country-blocker/ "WordPress - IP2Location Country Blocker - WordPress Plugins")
), this plugin uses its local database prior to the REST APIs.
After installing these IP2Location plugins, you should be once deactivated 
and then activated in order to set the path to `database.bin`.

3. Cache mechanism with transient API for the fetched IP addresses has been 
equipped to reduce load on the server against burst access within a short time.

4. Custom validation function can be added using predefined filter hook with 
`add_filter()`.

== Installation ==

= Using The WordPress Dashboard =

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
2. Search for 'IP Geo Block'
3. Click 'Install Now'
4. Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard

= Settings =

* **Service provider and API key**  
    If you wish to use `IPInfoDB`, you should register from 
    [their site](http://ipinfodb.com/ "IPInfoDB | Free IP Address Geolocation Tools") 
    to get a free API key and set it into the textfield.
    And `ip-api.com` and `Smart-IP.net` require non-commercial use.

* **Validation settings**  
    `XML-RPC` is for validation of pingback spam. If `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` is 
    checked, all the IP addresses in `$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']` will be
    validated.

* **Text position on comment form**  
    If you want to put some text message on your comment form, please select
    `Top` or `Bottom` and put text into the **Text message on comment form**
    textfield.

* **Matching rule**  
    Select `White list` (recommended) or `Black list` to specify the countries
    from which you want to pass or block.

* **White list**, **Black list**  
    Specify the country code with two letters (see 
    [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements "ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")
    ). Each of them should be separated by comma.

* **Response code**  
    Select one of the 
    [response code](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10 "RFC 2616 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1")
    to be sent when it blocks a comment.
    The 2xx code will lead to your top page, the 3xx code will redirect to 
    [Black Hole Server](http://blackhole.webpagetest.org/),
    the 4xx code will lead to WordPress error page, and the 5xx will pretend 
    an server error.

* **Remove settings at uninstallation**  
    If you checked this option, all settings will be removed when this plugin
    is uninstalled for clean uninstalling.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this plugin for? =

It's for blocking spam comments. If you can not specify countries with white 
list or black list to protect your site against undesired access, you should 
choose other awesome plugins.

= How can I check this plugin works? =

Check `statistics` tab on this plugin's option page.

= How can I test on the local site? =

There are two ways. One is to add some code somewhere in your php (typically 
`functions.php` in your theme) to substitute local IP address through filter 
fook `ip-geo-block-ip-addr` as follows:

`function my_replace_ip( $ip ) {
    return '98.139.183.24'; // yahoo.com
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-ip-addr', 'my_replace_ip' );`

Another method is adding a country code into `White list` or `Black list` on 
the plugin settings page. Most of the IP Geolocation services return empty 
(with some status) if a local IP address (e.g. 127.0.0.0) is sent, but only 
`freegeoip.net` returns `RD`.

= Can I add an additional validation function into this plugin? =

Yes, you can use `add_filter()` with filter hook `ip-geo-block-comment` in 
somewhere (typically `functions.php` in your theme) as follows:

`function my_blacklist( $validate ) {
    $blacklist = array(
        '123.456.789.',
    );

    foreach ( $blacklist as $ip ) {
        if ( strpos( $ip, $validate['ip'] ) === 0 ) {
            $validate['result'] = 'blocked';
            break;
        }
    }

    return $validate;
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-comment', 'my_blacklist' );`

= Can I change user agent strings when fetching services? =

Yes. The default is something like `Wordpress/4.0; ip-geo-block 1.2.0`.
You can change it as follows:

`function my_user_agent( $args ) {
    $args['user-agent'] = 'my user agent strings';
    return $args;
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-headers', 'my_user_agent' );`

= Are there any other filter hooks? =

Yes, here is the list of all hooks.

* `ip-geo-block-ip-addr`          : IP address of accessor.
* `ip-geo-block-headers`          : compose http request headers.
* `ip-geo-block-comment`          : validate post to `wp-comments-post.php` and `pingback.ping` to `xmlrpc.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-maxmind-dir`      : absolute path where Maxmind GeoLite DB files should be saved.
* `ip-geo-block-maxmind-zip-ipv4` : url to Maxmind GeoLite DB zip file for IPv4.
* `ip-geo-block-maxmind-zip-ipv6` : url to Maxmind GeoLite DB zip file for IPv6.
* `ip-geo-block-ip2location-path` : absolute path to IP2Location LITE DB file.

For more details, see `samples.php` bundled within this package.

== Other Notes ==

If you do not want to keep the IP2Location plugins (
    [IP2Location Tags](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-tags/ "WordPress - IP2Location Tags - WordPress Plugins"),
    [IP2Location Variables](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-variables/ "WordPress - IP2Location Variables - WordPress Plugins"),
    [IP2Location Country Blocker](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-country-blocker/ "WordPress - IP2Location Country Blocker - WordPress Plugins")
) in `wp-content/plugins/` directory but just want to use its database, 
you can rename it to `ip2location` and upload it to `wp-content/`.
