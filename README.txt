It blocks any spams, login attempts and malicious access to the admin area 
posted from outside your nation, and also prevents zero-day exploit.

== Description ==

There are some cases of a site being infected. The first one is the case 
that contaminated files are uploaded via FTP or some kind of uploaders. 
In this case, scaning and verifing integrity of files in your site is useful 
to detect the infection.

The second one is cracking of the login username and password. In this case, 
the rule of right is to strengthen the password.

The third one is caused by malicious access to the core files. The major issue 
in this case is that a plugin or theme in your site can potentially have some 
vulnerability such as XSS, CSRF, SQLi, LFI and so on. For example, if a plugin 
has vulnerability of Local File Inclusion (LFI), the attackers can easily 
download the `wp-config.php` without knowing the username and password by 
simply hitting 
    [wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=show-me&file=../wp-config.php](http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/slider-revolution-plugin-critical-vulnerability-being-exploited.html "Slider Revolution Plugin Critical Vulnerability Being Exploited | Sucuri Blog")
on their browser.

For these cases, the protection based on the IP address is not a perfect 
solution for everyone. But for some site owners or some certain cases such 
as 'zero-day attack', it can still reduce the risk of infection against the 
specific attacks.

That's why this plugin is here.

= Features =

This plugin will examine a country code based on the IP address. If a comment, 
pingback or trackback comes from the specific country, it will be blocked 
before Akismet validate it.

With the same mechanism, it will fight against burst access of brute-force 
and reverse-brute-force attacks to the login form, XML-RPC and admin area.

1. Access to the basic and important entrances into the back-end such as 
 `wp-comments-post.php`, `xmlrpc.php`, `wp-login.php`, `wp-admin/admin.php`,
 `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`, `wp-admin/admin-post.php` will be validated by 
means of a country code based on IP address.

2. In order to prevent the invasion through the login form and XML-RPC against 
the brute-force and the reverse-brute-force attacks, the number of login 
attempts will be limited per IP address. This feature works independently from 
blocking by country code.

3. Besides blocking by country code, the original new feature '**Z**ero-day 
**E**xploit **P**revention for wp-admin' (WP-ZEP) is now available to block 
malicious access to `wp-admin/*.php`. It will protect against certain types 
of attack such as CSRF, SQLi and so on even if you have some 
    [vulnerable plugins](https://wpvulndb.com/ "WPScan Vulnerability Database")
in your site. Because this is an experimental feature, please open an issue at 
    [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ip-geo-block "WordPress &#8250; Support &raquo; IP Geo Block")
if you have any troubles. I'll be profoundly grateful your contribution to 
improve this feature. See more details on 
    [this plugin's blog](http://tokkonopapa.github.io/WordPress-IP-Geo-Block/ "Blog of IP Geo Block").

4. HTTP Response code can be selected as `403 Forbidden` to deny access pages, 
 `404 Not Found` to hide pages or even `200 OK` to redirect to the top page.

5. Referer suppressor for external link. When you click an external hyperlink 
on admin screen, http referer will be eliminated to hide a footprint of your 
site.

6. Validation logs will be recorded into MySQL data table to audit posting 
pattern under the specified condition.

7. Free IP Geolocation database and REST APIs are installed into this plugin 
to get a country code from an IP address. There are two types of API which 
support only IPv4 or both IPv4 and IPv6. This plugin will automatically select 
an appropriate API.

8. A cache mechanism with transient API for the fetched IP addresses has been 
equipped to reduce load on the server against the burst accesses with a short 
period of time.

9. [MaxMind](http://www.maxmind.com "MaxMind - IP Geolocation and Online Fraud Prevention") 
GeoLite free database for IPv4 and IPv6 will be downloaded and updated 
(once a month) automatically. And if you have correctly installed 
one of the IP2Location plugins (
    [IP2Location Tags](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-tags/ "WordPress - IP2Location Tags - WordPress Plugins"),
    [IP2Location Variables](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-variables/ "WordPress - IP2Location Variables - WordPress Plugins"),
    [IP2Location Country Blocker](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-country-blocker/ "WordPress - IP2Location Country Blocker - WordPress Plugins")
), this plugin uses its local database prior to the REST APIs.

10. This plugin is simple and lite enough to be able to cooperate with other 
full spec security plugin such as 
    [Wordfence Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/ "WordPress › Wordfence Security « WordPress Plugins")
(because the function of country bloking is available only for premium users).

11. You can customize the basic behavior of this plugin via `add_filter()` with 
pre-defined filter hook. See various use cases in 
    [samples.php](https://github.com/tokkonopapa/WordPress-IP-Geo-Block/blob/master/ip-geo-block/samples.php "WordPress-IP-Geo-Block/samples.php at master - tokkonopapa/WordPress-IP-Geo-Block - GitHub")
bundled within this package.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I was locked down. What shall I do? =

Add the following codes to `functions.php` in your theme and upload it via FTP.

`function my_emergency( $validate ) {
    $validate['result'] = 'passed';
    return $validate;
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-login', 'my_emergency' );
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-admin', 'my_emergency' );`

Then `Clear cache` at `Statistics` tab on your dashborad. After that, you can 
remove above codes.

= How can I protect my `wp-config.php` against malicious access? =

`function my_protectives( $validate ) {
    $blacklist = array(
        'wp-config.php',
        'passwd',
    );

    $req = strtolower( urldecode( serialize( $_GET + $_POST ) ) );

    foreach ( $blacklist as $item ) {
        if ( strpos( $req, $item ) !== FALSE ) {
            $validate['result'] = 'blocked';
            break;
        }
    }

    return $validate; // should not set 'passed' to validate by country code
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-admin', 'my_protectives' );`

= Are there any other filter hooks? =

Yes, here is the list of all hooks.

* `ip-geo-block-ip-addr`          : IP address of accessor.
* `ip-geo-block-headers`          : compose http request headers.
* `ip-geo-block-comment`          : validate IP address at `wp-comments-post.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-xmlrpc`           : validate IP address at `xmlrpc.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-login`            : validate IP address at `wp-login.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-admin`            : validate IP address at `wp-admin/*.php`.

bundled within this package.

= How does WP-ZEP prevent zero-day attack? =

A considerable number of vulnerable plugins are lacking in validating either 
the nonce and privilege or both. WP-ZEP will make up both of them embedding a 
nonce into the link, form and ajax request from jQuery on every admin screen.

This simple system will validate both of them on behalf of vulnerable plugins 
in your site and will block a request with a query parameter `action` through 
 `wp-admin/(admin|admin-ajax|admin-post).php` if it has no nonce and privilege.
Moreover, it doesn't affects a request from non-logged-in user.

On the other hand, the details of above process are slightly delicate. For 
example, it's incapable of preventing Privilege Escalation (PE) because it 
can't be decided which capabilities does the request need.

See more details on 
[this plugin's blog](http://tokkonopapa.github.io/WordPress-IP-Geo-Block/ "Blog of IP Geo Block").

= Some admin function doesn't work when WP-ZEP is on. =

There are a few cases that WP-ZEP would not work. One is redirection at server 
side (by PHP or `.htaccess`) and client side (by JavaScript location object or 
meta tag for refresh).

Another is the case related to the content type. This plugin will only support 
 `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data`.

The other case is that a ajax/post request comes from not jQuery but flash or 
something.

In those cases, this plugin should bypass WP-ZEP. So please find the `action` 
in the requested queries and add its value into the safe action list via the 
filter hook `ip-geo-block-admin-actions`.

If you can not figure out your troubles, please let me know about the plugin 
you are using at the support forum.

= I want to use only WP-ZEP. =

Uncheck the `Comment post`, `XML-RPC` and `Login form` in `Validation settings` 
on `Settings` tab. And select `Prevent zero-day exploit` for `Admin area`.

At last empty the textfield of `White list` or `Black list` according to the 
 `Matching rule`.

== Other Notes ==

After installing these IP2Location plugins, you should be once deactivated 
and then activated in order to set the path to `database.bin`.

If you do not want to keep the IP2Location plugins (
    [IP2Location Tags](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-tags/ "WordPress - IP2Location Tags - WordPress Plugins"),
    [IP2Location Variables](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-variables/ "WordPress - IP2Location Variables - WordPress Plugins"),
    [IP2Location Country Blocker](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-country-blocker/ "WordPress - IP2Location Country Blocker - WordPress Plugins")
) in `wp-content/plugins/` directory but just want to use its database, 
you can rename it to `ip2location` and upload it to `wp-content/`.

== Changelog ==

= 2.1.0 =
* **New feature:** Expanded the operating range of ZP-ZEP, that includes admin 
  area, plugins area, themes area. Now it can prevent a direct malicios attack 
  to the file in plugins and themes area. Please go to the "Validation Settings"
  on "Settings" tab and check it. Also check my article in 
  "[Analysis of Attack Vector against WP Plugins](http://tokkonopapa.github.io/WordPress-IP-Geo-Block/article/analysis-attack-vector.html)".
* **Bug fix:** Fixed the issue that action hook `ip-geo-block-backup-dir` did 
  not work correctly because the order of argument was mismatched.

  [example](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/08/database-takeover-in-custom-contact-forms.html "Critical Vulnerability Disclosed on WordPress Custom Contact Forms Plugin")
  ) could not be blocked by the reason that some plugins accept it on earlier 
  hook (ie `init`) than this plugin (previously `admin_init`).
* Added re-creating DB table for validation logs in case of accidentally 
  failed at activation process.
* The time of day is shown with local time by adding GMT offset based on 
  the time zone setting.

  hide a footprint of your site.
* Also added the filter hook `ip-geo-block-admin-actions` for safe actions 
  on back-end.

= 2.0.2 =
* **New feature:** Include `wp-admin/admin-post.php` as a validation target 
  in the `Admin area`. This feature is to protect against a vulnerability
